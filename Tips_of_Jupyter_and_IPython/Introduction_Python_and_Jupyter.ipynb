    "## Python, IPython and Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Python is a programming language designed to promote code that is easy to read and write. Python has become one of the most important languages in scientific computing. It is high-level like MATLAB, but unlike MATLAB it is free and is intended as a general-purpose language.\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython is a collection of tools for interactive programming in Python. Most importantly for us, IPython includes an interactive shell and a browser-based notebook. The notebook (known as the jupyter notebook now) allows you to run Python code in your web browser; just click on a cell with code and hit shift+enter."

    "## Why use Python?\n",
    "<!---Hopefully this brief adventure has convinced you that Python is a worthwhile programming language. Some of the reasons I chose Python as the language for this course (and other courses I teach) are: --->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compared to lower-level languages like C, C++, and Fortran, Python code is easier to write and read (meaning fewer bugs!)\n",
    "- A huge number of available libraries means it is easy to get things done in Python without writing a lot of code yourself\n",
    "- Python is a general-purpose programming language, with features (like optional arguments with defaults) that lead to more elegant, maintainable code than what you can write with specialized languages like MATLAB.\n",
    "- Python is free and comes installed on most systems. You can run this whole course with only a web browser and access to the internet.\n",
    "- It's easy to incorporate code written in other languages into your Python programs.\n",
    "- It's often easy to parallelize existing scientific codes using Python.\n",
