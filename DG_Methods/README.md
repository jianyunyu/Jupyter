## Introduction 

In these jupyter-notebook, we will give a general demonstration of implementing the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving time dependent, convection dominated partial differential equations (PDEs), including the hyperbolic conservation laws, convection diffusion equations, and PDEs containing higher order spatial derivatives.
