## Introduction
The course of Numerical Analysis should teach both mathematical theory of
numerical analysis and the craft of implementing numerical algorithms.
Unfortunatly, usually only the mathematical theory is actually mentioned in the
course syllabus/textbook.  This is the reason and motivation for creating these
Jupyter-notebooks.  The Jupyter-notebook provides a single medium in which
mathematics, explanations, executable code, and visualizations can be combined,
and with which the student can interact in order to learn both the theory and
the craft of numerical algorithms. 

**Important Note:**
* Crafts are not generally taught through lectures and textbooks: rather, one
  learns a craft by _doing_.

## How to Use
These notebooks are published on [Github](https://github.com/xiaozhouli/Jupyter/tree/master/Numerical_Analysis) for public.  If you only want to have
a view of the notebooks, you can just go to the following [Nbviewer link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xiaozhouli/Jupyter/tree/master/Numerical_Analysis/)

Also, you can simply download the notebooks and play with them yourself.  Of course, then you need a local installation of Jupyter-notebook.  One of the easist way to install everything you need is to use the [Anaconda platform](https://www.anaconda.com).
